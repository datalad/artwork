This segment of hak5 is brought to you by goto assist

0:00:06.460,0:00:11.849
This week I decided to check out an alternative to Dropbox. This is kind of cool

0:00:11.849,0:00:14.129
It's called get annex assistant

0:00:14.130,0:00:19.500
It started as a Kickstarter last year, and it raised well over there funds on the first day

0:00:19.779,0:00:21.270
It's kind of exciting now

0:00:21.270,0:00:26.339
This is a good alternative again to a company owned file sharing service similar to Dropbox

0:00:26.740,0:00:33.270
Get annex assistant will let you synchronize a folder on to each device of your choosing whether the contents are on a folder on

0:00:33.370,0:00:36.930
The same location a USB a different computer

0:00:36.930,0:00:37.840
Or where have you?

0:00:37.840,0:00:43.739
Now I did mention that this was based on git it's also based on get annex if you go to their website

0:00:43.739,0:00:49.649
They basically say get annex allows managing files with git without checking the file contents in to get

0:00:49.840,0:00:55.349
While that may seem paradoxical it is useful when dealing with files larger than get it can

0:00:55.989,0:01:02.429
Which get cannot currently easily handle whether due to limitations a memory time or disk space so?

0:01:02.949,0:01:10.859
Basically, this is telling you cool. I can actually upload things like you know my mp3 files or or my hack five episodes, or what-have-you

0:01:11.409,0:01:18.329
Now for me to install this first. I had to get the precise PPA version for Ubuntu everything is on their website

0:01:18.330,0:01:20.330
So they make it pretty simple

0:01:20.500,0:01:26.669
You go to install and you choose the file version that you need now first off. I did try just getting

0:01:27.250,0:01:32.819
Doing apt-get install git annex, but if you click into a boon to you. You're only gonna get

0:01:33.340,0:01:38.369
Get enix with that one now what I wanted to do was get the web app for the assistant

0:01:38.439,0:01:41.099
This is what I really want to check out for this segment today

0:01:41.259,0:01:44.939
So I had to use sudo apt-get repository get the PPA

0:01:45.430,0:01:50.759
update and then install git annex now when I did that it actually gave me the web app and

0:01:50.979,0:01:52.979
A very easy way to get to it

0:01:53.470,0:01:54.520
Yet

0:01:54.520,0:01:56.520
annex

0:01:57.230,0:01:59.710
This is going to automatically open up the web app

0:02:01.410,0:02:04.039
So the first thing you need to do is create your very first

0:02:04.410,0:02:11.359
Repository the default is in slash and annex are on the desktop in that desktop directory then from there

0:02:11.360,0:02:16.070
You can start creating folders and other places such as a USB Drive another place on your computer

0:02:16.500,0:02:19.580
another computer or up in the cloud if you want to I

0:02:19.860,0:02:22.610
Created a second one on my computer in the home directory

0:02:22.800,0:02:30.079
So now I'm gonna go ahead and let you see how exactly I did that so on here. You can see that. I have one

0:02:30.930,0:02:32.960
Which is Shannon shared files and?

0:02:33.780,0:02:35.839
I can also choose to add another repository

0:02:36.720,0:02:38.370
configure and

0:02:38.370,0:02:40.370
also, see

0:02:40.500,0:02:47.509
Down here where I can restart the entire daemon whenever you restart it. This is basically going to let you restart the syncing

0:02:47.510,0:02:51.230
It's going to pick up any kind of syncing capabilities that are going on in the background

0:02:51.360,0:02:57.499
Any files that are currently being uploaded would now be seen so I'm gonna go ahead and restart the daemon

0:03:00.930,0:03:04.849
Okay, so now we see I have both here Shannon shared files

0:03:04.849,0:03:09.799
That is my home folder, and I also have Shannon Ubuntu. PC, which is the desktop slash annex?

0:03:09.800,0:03:15.619
I actually have a physical folder right here on my awesome sailormoon wallpaper desktop and

0:03:16.110,0:03:20.479
In here I have one file if I close that I'm gonna go into the home folder

0:03:22.040,0:03:24.040
You

0:03:24.430,0:03:26.890
The shared folder which is my second repository?

0:03:26.890,0:03:32.979
I also have 1412 - snubs so both of these files are the exact same thing

0:03:33.049,0:03:39.459
I was just able to drag and drop into my shared folder and that automatically synced on to you the annex folder on my desktop

0:03:40.040,0:03:44.650
Now if you wanted to do the same thing you would go to add another repository

0:03:46.069,0:03:49.688
So this gives you the option and I'll zoom in right here

0:03:50.150,0:03:55.209
This is going to give you the option to add a repository from a removable flash drive

0:03:55.209,0:04:02.048
Which will actually backup every time that you plug the flash drive into your computer you can share it with other other devices

0:04:02.329,0:04:08.679
Including Android devices, which is really cool. You can share with a friend on another computer a local computer on the same

0:04:09.290,0:04:13.599
On the same network that you're using or add a completely different repository

0:04:13.599,0:04:18.339
It also gives you the option to use box rsync s3 or remote server

0:04:18.769,0:04:22.059
glacier and internet archive now of course

0:04:22.060,0:04:24.050
I haven't gotten into those so much

0:04:24.050,0:04:26.859
But what I will do is go ahead and add another repository

0:04:27.080,0:04:31.900
Onto my current computer my little laptop that kind of works sometimes and kind of doesn't

0:04:32.120,0:04:39.250
So I'm gonna add another repository down here, and this is what you'll see it's going to say add another local repository

0:04:39.250,0:04:43.750
Where do you want to add this you can choose your folder so for me?

0:04:43.750,0:04:47.919
I have documents shared folder a bunch of other ones in there, so I'll do another

0:04:49.669,0:04:51.560
Shared

0:04:51.560,0:04:53.560
Get older

0:04:55.330,0:04:57.330
Make repository and

0:04:57.440,0:05:04.359
it's going to ask you if you want to combine it with your existing one or if you want to combine the repositories or

0:05:04.910,0:05:10.479
Have the files placed in two separate repositories and not actually sync with each other obviously

0:05:10.480,0:05:13.330
I want them to sync with each other, so I'm going to combine them

0:05:15.180,0:05:17.180
You can name it

0:05:17.640,0:05:21.770
Shared tooth a description files, yeh

0:05:23.610,0:05:24.630
Repository group

0:05:24.630,0:05:29.179
So this gives you a group that you can put them into since you could make several and several

0:05:29.610,0:05:34.490
Repositories this will give you some kind of organization to all those different ones so when you get into it

0:05:34.490,0:05:42.439
You don't get completely screwed up on where all those different folders and directories are so this is client a repository on my computer

0:05:44.200,0:05:49.410
Synching is enabled and you save changes so now I have all three here

0:05:49.750,0:05:56.069
Syncing is enabled in each one I can go to settings and edit if I need to I can disable them and remove them

0:05:56.250,0:05:57.670
I can also

0:05:57.670,0:05:59.670
restart my daemon

0:05:59.830,0:06:01.979
Now I'm gonna open up my home folder

0:06:04.660,0:06:07.719
And go ahead and open up that new folder that I just created

0:06:08.330,0:06:14.949
Shared get so I want to share with myself. I'm gonna say 14 13 some really old show notes

0:06:16.340,0:06:20.290
So right now. That's just right here 14 13 if I go back

0:06:22.270,0:06:25.259
It's currently not in there quite yet, so

0:06:25.990,0:06:27.990
Go ahead and restart

0:06:28.000,0:06:32.489
And obviously this will be a little bit faster in the background if you just left it running in the background

0:06:32.650,0:06:39.299
Eventually it will sync all of your documents, but since I'm doing this for hack 5. I want it to go a little bit faster

0:06:40.030,0:06:42.030
So I go ahead and sync

0:06:45.240,0:06:47.240
And I'm going to refresh

0:06:49.370,0:06:53.530
So now I have 14 12 and 14 13 and

0:06:54.289,0:06:56.289
all of my different folders and

0:06:56.870,0:07:03.340
These both should also be shared with my annex folder, and it is so there's my new file

0:07:03.650,0:07:07.660
So now you know how to use get annex assistant?

0:07:07.669,0:07:14.948
Which is a very easy to use web app with get and get annex as the background on them, so it's very simple

0:07:14.949,0:07:16.030
I really liked it

0:07:16.030,0:07:18.030
And it's also a very great

0:07:18.110,0:07:24.430
Alternative in case you don't want the entire government seeing everything that you're doing on the Internet's you can just use your own

0:07:24.860,0:07:26.020
repositories now

0:07:26.020,0:07:30.759
let me know about your feedback and what you like about this segment and tell me what other

0:07:30.889,0:07:35.288
Options you use do you use own cloud for example? That's another one I've heard of

0:07:35.840,0:07:40.479
Definitely send me an email at feedback at hack 5 org and I'll love to check it out
