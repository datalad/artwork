Hello in this second video. I'm going to use the virtual machine

0:00:04.270,0:00:10.629
We created to look at a single subjects data the clinical scenario is a child who has been having left funnel onset seizures

0:00:10.789,0:00:14.319
Who's had normal Mris, but a pet scan showing left hypometabolism?

0:00:15.139,0:00:21.009
Here we're going to look for signs of subtle cortical thickness that might overlap with the pet data. Let's get started

0:00:23.310,0:00:26.719
First we'll need to get our patients Dicom files from Radiology

0:00:27.270,0:00:30.739
The Ginkgo Cad x software that you installed on the first video?

0:00:30.990,0:00:35.239
Will allow you to retrieve the files directly from a Dicom note if you have the address and port number

0:00:36.030,0:00:38.900
However the settings you will need will vary from institution to institution

0:00:39.600,0:00:41.900
These can be set by going to tools

0:00:44.160,0:00:51.229
Settings and clicking on Dicom nodes on the left create a new entry and entering the relevant information

0:00:52.860,0:00:53.910
for now

0:00:53.910,0:00:59.570
let's assume that you have the dicom images from the subjects MrI and pet studies on a CD or thumb drive on

0:00:59.640,0:01:03.559
Your host computer copy the files into the shared folder we created earlier

0:01:06.720,0:01:12.919
then open a terminal [window] and navigate to the shared Folder by entering CD space [host]

0:01:14.100,0:01:17.960
We can list the files to see verify that the data is here

0:01:21.360,0:01:23.360
And move back to our home directory

0:01:29.480,0:01:35.259
Let's convert the die comes into nifty Format. Which is the most commonly used imaging file Format outside of Clinical Radiology

0:01:35.990,0:01:39.100
By using the command DcM to an aye-aye

0:01:47.120,0:01:53.770
You'll notice that the the dicom two nifty command created reoriented and cropped versions of the nifty file as well

0:01:56.480,0:02:03.850
Labeled with the same file name with an o in the front for oriented and ceo for cropped and oriented

0:02:05.030,0:02:08.470
Let's also convert our pet data from Dicom to nifty as well

0:02:11.060,0:02:14.920
Next we'll take a look at these files with the slices program from FSL

0:02:15.470,0:02:19.959
slices only works on nifty files, but gives you a quick snapshot of what the volume looks like

0:02:21.560,0:02:29.190
Here we'll look at the difference between the original T1 as it was stored by the scanner and the reoriented T1 and conventional neuroimaging orientation

0:02:43.710,0:02:49.739
As you can see the data has simply been rotated by 90 degree increments, and this does not degrade the data quality

0:02:51.670,0:02:56.729
We can also examine the cropped version which as you would expect has had the empty space removed

0:02:58.120,0:03:01.379
Please be aware that some MrI vendors turn on JpEG compression

0:03:01.720,0:03:05.100
inside of their die comms if your images look like this image on the left

0:03:05.290,0:03:09.150
The navigate to the main directory for your Dicom images and run the command

0:03:09.520,0:03:16.230
Dicom decompress all one word all lower case then return to the step above and rerun DCM to Nii

0:03:17.980,0:03:21.899
let's copy the standard oriented file to our home directory and

0:03:23.530,0:03:25.530
Then take a look at our pet data

0:03:27.460,0:03:33.120
we can navigate to the pet folder list all the files just ending in Gz and

0:03:33.910,0:03:36.180
Do these files with slices as well [I]?

0:03:36.940,0:03:39.210
Know in advance that this file is the one we want

0:03:39.880,0:03:41.770
and

0:03:41.770,0:03:44.850
There you see the pet data looks like a fuzzy image of the brain

0:03:47.530,0:03:49.890
Will copy this file to our home directory as well

0:03:52.120,0:03:58.649
Before [we] run free surfers reconstruction script using the subjects T1 file. Let's rename things to be a bit easier to read

0:03:58.900,0:04:05.040
We'll rename the T1 file t 1 dot nifty Jeezy and the pet Data FDGFdg

0:04:06.040,0:04:08.040
z

0:04:09.640,0:04:13.140
Run the command sub der su. Be dir

0:04:13.630,0:04:18.600
Which is an alias for the command to let freesurfer know we're going to be making subject files in the current directory

0:04:20.230,0:04:26.520
Then and then we'll run recon all which is free surfers primary surface reconstruction and volumetric segmentation script

0:04:27.010,0:04:32.189
This will take about 7 to 12 hours depending on your computer make sure you are not logged off during that time

0:04:32.320,0:04:34.320
We will continue when that is done

0:04:34.960,0:04:37.829
Now they're free surfers done analyzing the subjects t1

0:04:37.830,0:04:44.549
We can view the results either within the freesurfer provided tools like free view or use the human connection projects workbench Viewer I?

0:04:44.680,0:04:49.920
Prefer [the] latter as I find it easier to load and view [all] of the subjects files at once and can be run on windows

0:04:49.920,0:04:53.309
Machines easily allowing more portability to do this

0:04:53.310,0:05:01.019
I've written a basic script you see here called freesurfer 2h p workbench converter at the command Line type in this command

0:05:01.389,0:05:03.418
followed by the name of our subject

0:05:04.330,0:05:06.330
This will take about 30 minutes or so

0:05:09.999,0:05:13.469
We will also want to look at our patients FDG pet scan as well

0:05:13.629,0:05:20.998
So we should register this with the T1 Mp rage for this we'll use a software package called ants which stands for Advanced normalization tools?

0:05:21.429,0:05:27.089
Since the pet Data is effectively just a fuzzy image of the brain you may need to register it to an image of a brain

0:05:27.189,0:05:33.299
Extracted from our T1 instead of the original image with skull and necks intact this is often the [case] with FMRI results as [well]

0:05:33.669,0:05:36.838
The brain extracted image can be found in the subjects one

0:05:37.899,0:05:44.339
Mri subdirectory, and is called Brand Mg. Z which is free surfers mgH harvard formatted file

0:05:45.039,0:05:48.838
We can convert this to nifty by using the Command MrI underscore convert

0:05:49.089,0:05:50.669
if the name of the original file

0:05:50.669,0:05:55.348
And then the name of the file with the new extension that we want this program knows

0:05:55.509,0:05:58.859
to convert this from MgH s formats and if [t] format

0:06:00.189,0:06:03.239
We can then make sure that this is oriented in the correct orientation

0:06:04.059,0:06:06.958
using [fo] [cells] reorient to standard command

0:06:08.080,0:06:10.080
Will send the output to our home directory

0:06:12.639,0:06:15.948
And we can verify that this is correct by using slices

0:06:23.530,0:06:30.030
We can also compare this to our fDG pet scan from before to see that in fact both do look pretty similar

0:06:30.030,0:06:32.030
But still need to be registered together I

0:06:33.490,0:06:39.960
Made an alias for the ants registration command called ants quick as you can see here to make things easier

0:06:39.960,0:06:47.039
So to register the FDG image to the brain image we can enter ants quick, Dash [d] 3 for 3 dimensions

0:06:47.590,0:06:49.980
Dashti a for a fine transformation

0:06:50.650,0:06:53.730
dash f for fixed and give the brain image

0:06:54.340,0:07:01.470
Dash m for movable and give the f dG image, and then what's helped to label the output as fDG to brain you

0:07:04.600,0:07:12.240
can see here as this starts how these different input variables get coded into options for the registration computation

0:07:12.730,0:07:15.629
This will take a few minutes, so we'll continue when this is done. We

0:07:22.210,0:07:26.309
Can verify that the registration worked by using slices on both files together?

0:07:26.650,0:07:32.489
You'll notice that the output from the ants registration is FTD to brain warped Nifty Gz

0:07:33.250,0:07:38.250
Specifying two images for the slices command tells it to use the second image as a red edged

0:07:38.830,0:07:44.429
Overlay as you can see here and you can see that the two files actually line up quite well now

0:07:46.420,0:07:47.560
We can then add

0:07:47.560,0:07:50.280
This to our work bench data set by using another script

0:07:50.280,0:07:55.589
I've put together at the command enter import volume to spec and then give the subject name

0:07:56.410,0:07:58.410
the volume name

0:08:01.810,0:08:06.310
a short label tool for the file in this case FDG and

0:08:07.280,0:08:14.530
Then which layers you want to intersect the data with either the peel surface the mid thickness surface for the white matter service

0:08:14.530,0:08:16.280
or all three

0:08:16.280,0:08:22.089
I'll cancel this to show you the usage of the command as you can see here with an example

0:08:28.160,0:08:35.349
We'll go ahead and select the command and run it now this takes a few minutes

0:08:40.130,0:08:43.119
now from within our subjects HCP subdirectory

0:08:44.300,0:08:50.169
We can start the workbench viewer software by typing WB Underscore view at the command Line choose the

0:08:50.630,0:08:53.229
164 K spec file by double-clicking on it and

0:08:54.200,0:08:58.539
Then click load to load all of the files within the spec or specification file

0:08:58.760,0:09:04.119
There are several tutorials online that can walk you through all the features of the software so in the interest of time

0:09:04.120,0:09:08.890
I'll simply show you some of the features pertinent to our present clinical set clinical situation

0:09:09.410,0:09:16.810
Once the data loads you will see the left and right cortical make thickness surfaces labeled with the desiccant [colony] atlas regions for the subject

0:09:17.210,0:09:22.960
You can click on the volume tab [tolu] the so view the loaded nifty files and scroll through in different planes

0:09:27.290,0:09:28.580
or

0:09:28.580,0:09:33.879
The all tab to load both the service renderings and volume slices at the same time here

0:09:33.880,0:09:37.809
You can rotate and slide the volume slices to examine particular regions in detail

0:09:38.390,0:09:40.659
let's return to the Montage pain and

0:09:42.260,0:09:48.369
Here you can see the mid thickness surface is currently loaded you can turn off various views with these checkboxes here

0:09:49.940,0:09:51.830
and

0:09:51.830,0:09:57.069
Also change the displayed services from the default mid thickness Gray to the peel surface

0:10:00.080,0:10:06.429
as you can see on the left an inflated surface that lets you more easily see data in the [Sulci] a

0:10:07.610,0:10:12.760
Very inflated surface, which is even more so or even the underlying spherical representation

0:10:13.400,0:10:15.479
the white Matter services also available

0:10:16.160,0:10:17.810
we'll reset this to the

0:10:17.810,0:10:25.030
[grey] mid thickness layer you can also change the overlay for the from the segmentation its other calculated measures such as thickness

0:10:25.430,0:10:30.610
Which you can see here in Rainbow color scale we can adjust the color scale and range by clicking on the wrench icon

0:10:31.550,0:10:38.830
Here you can see the average cortical thickness is around 3 millimeters and we can adjust the range to better Demonstrate Clinical extremes

0:10:46.160,0:10:53.889
Interestingly you can also view the two hemispheres as unfolded flat sheets which allows you to view the entire circle Cortex as [ones]

0:10:54.710,0:10:57.759
Will change the overlay to the calculated thickness and look for abnormalities?

0:10:58.070,0:11:03.760
Noting that there's a normal pattern that you will recognize after looking at a few subjects this area here

0:11:04.760,0:11:10.569
Seems to indicate a focal thickening of the left medial frontal Cortex that might correlate with the suspected seizure onset Zone

0:11:11.030,0:11:13.660
if we return to the 3D Surface views

0:11:14.720,0:11:19.059
We can switch to the medial view and see more clearly where this area is

0:11:20.420,0:11:25.839
You can see that there does seem to be sending asymmetry here comparing the left and right cingulate cortices

0:11:27.230,0:11:33.879
In addition to visual inspection you can also click on the 3D models to gain information about that location if we click on our

0:11:33.980,0:11:37.929
Suspected lesion you can see that the calculated thickness is 4.6. Four millimeters

0:11:39.440,0:11:43.300
You can also choose to view this data overlaid on the original T1 image

0:11:44.030,0:11:48.009
You can see here that the location we clicked on is also identified by crosshairs

0:11:49.040,0:11:54.609
Will move the overlay toolbox from the bottom over to the left by clicking on view

0:11:57.680,0:11:59.680
and

0:11:59.690,0:12:01.690
then add in this patient's

0:12:01.970,0:12:06.850
FdG-pet skin as well by clicking on the Checkbox next to it. We adjust the color scale

0:12:06.950,0:12:12.189
We can more easily see if the area of hypometabolism indeed alliance with the area of increased cortical thickness

0:12:12.190,0:12:12.830
I

0:12:12.830,0:12:18.160
typically choose values that exclude the extremes and gives dynamic range to the upper half of the pet data

0:12:18.230,0:12:20.380
to look for areas of cortical hypometabolism

0:12:21.500,0:12:22.550
in

0:12:22.550,0:12:25.750
Addition to the pet results we can bring up the surface based data

0:12:25.750,0:12:27.350
We were just looking at as well

0:12:27.350,0:12:33.759
Choose the left and right mid thickness surfaces and pick tab one to use the color scale we set up in that tab

0:12:34.820,0:12:38.980
You can also increase the visual thickness of the lines to more easily see the colors

0:12:46.250,0:12:49.420
Now you can see [that] this area of cortical thickness

0:12:50.180,0:12:52.180
Actually is aligned with the area of hypometabolism

0:12:52.820,0:12:57.280
We can also turn on the peel and white surfaces instead to give you a visual

0:12:57.380,0:13:01.150
Impression of the cortical thickness as well as allow you to see the underlying pet Data

0:13:03.320,0:13:05.320
We can also make the pet data

0:13:06.110,0:13:10.419
Transparent to allow the T1 Data to show through by either turning it on or off or

0:13:11.300,0:13:13.359
Adjusting the transparency setting here

0:13:19.990,0:13:22.419
As you can see there does seem to be some asymmetry

0:13:24.140,0:13:25.880
finally we can also

0:13:25.880,0:13:32.709
inspect the values from the pet volume where it intersects with the cortical surfaces to do this return to the montage view and choose the

0:13:32.709,0:13:36.639
left and right FDG layers from the overlay toolbox

0:13:38.660,0:13:43.870
Choose the ft. G on mid thickness intersection to look at cortical metabolism

0:13:46.279,0:13:49.958
Again, you can see the asymmetry between the left and right cingulate cortices

0:13:51.470,0:13:53.670
This concludes our practical demonstration

0:13:57.750,0:14:00.739
Illustrates the possibilities available with Modern or imaging tools

0:14:00.959,0:14:05.839
our goal is to encourage clinical trainees to become more interested in neuroimaging and help bridge the

0:14:06.029,0:14:10.609
Translational Gap between the neuroscience laboratory and the neurologists workroom. Thank you for watching
