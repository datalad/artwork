00:00
this is one get annex is awesome this is
00:03
just for small ways to show them just
00:06
why it's so awesome and why I use it so
00:10
get an except rest the content of your
00:14
harddrive from the index or the same the
00:17
way I use it in there's a number of ways
00:19
in which you can use get an axe is that
00:23
I have it set up for essentially most of
00:25
the phones do I have my home directory
00:27
so you can see I have this file book for
00:31
it which is normal text file citing this
00:33
get it up here and it's here now I can
00:37
ask get annex where this file is and you
00:42
will see that it actually exists in
00:43
three copies I have one copy here on my
00:46
laptop
00:46
I have two separate copies which are
00:49
distributed to essentially backup
00:51
storage that I have it's on a virtual
00:54
machine in Montreal and this station and
00:57
ass which I have it in my home both of
01:00
those were encrypted either with our
01:02
sync plus canopy G or with a key clip to
01:05
say get plus DB T now what I love about
01:12
get an axe is that I Kenya's drop this
01:15
file from my laptop
01:17
if I feel that I don't have a need for
01:18
it anymore if it's taking room or you
01:21
know for whatever reason I I don't need
01:23
it actively on my laptop but since get
01:27
an except raise the content from the
01:30
index the file is still there I can say
01:33
well the file is not there but I can see
01:35
it it's sort of unresolved because if I
01:39
try to do that I the file is not there I
01:42
can't get to it but if I shake where is
01:48
this phone I want to tell me that okay
01:51
is no longer in my laptop but it exists
01:53
in two different copies and those
01:54
virtual machines and I'm an ass and then
01:58
if I ever need it in any way hopefully
02:01
before I go offline then I just get that
02:04
file and it takes it from you know
02:06
whichever storage is the most convenient
02:08
and you can have any number of storages
02:10
you can mix and match as you want
02:13
you can have the monistic heart on USB
02:15
drives you know you name it and use them
02:17
to set up what kind of content you want
02:19
where and what priorities should be for
02:22
bringing things in order and yeah there
02:25
we had fun
02:26
that's get ax that's how I use it and
02:30
that's why I love it because I usually
02:32
have a lot of rather big files that I
02:34
shuffle around for videos and audio and
02:37
whatever and I don't space for terabytes
02:42
of data on my laptop but I still want to
02:44
see the index of what I have so we'd get
02:48
annexed as as possible I have an instant
02:50
view of all the files that I ever have
02:53
and I have everywhere but the fonts that
02:58
I work with actively are the ones that I
03:00
actually have immediate access to the
03:03
other ones I can retrieve when I need
03:04
them
