0:00:00.370,0:00:04.380
This is why git-annex is awesome.

0:00:04.380,0:00:07.379
This is just for some ways to show them just why it's so awesome

0:00:07.379,0:00:09.379
And why I use it

0:00:10.000,0:00:13.980
So git-annex separates  the content of your harddrive

0:00:13.980,0:00:17.020
from the index of the same

0:00:17.020,0:00:19.338
The way I use it, and there's a number of ways

0:00:19.338,0:00:20.850
in which you can use git annex

0:00:22.990,0:00:27.150
is that I have it set up

0:00:27.150,0:00:27.760
for essentially most of the files I have in my home directory

0:00:27.760,0:00:30.059
You can see - I have this file

0:00:30.820,0:00:35.459
Bookforare which is normal text file

0:00:35.459,0:00:36.370
so I can just get it up here, and it's here

0:00:36.370,0:00:38.740
Now I can ask git-annex

0:00:39.520,0:00:40.160
where this file is

0:00:40.170,0:00:44.141
and you will see that it actually exists in three copies.

0:00:44.141,0:00:46.440
I have one copy here on my laptop

0:00:46.829,0:00:49.049
I have two separate copies

0:00:49.090,0:00:52.206
Which are distributed to essentially backup storage

0:00:52.206,0:00:55.199
that I have it's on a virtual machine in Montreal

0:00:55.629,0:00:57.339
and this station and NAS

0:00:57.339,0:00:59.226
which I have it in my home

0:00:59.226,0:01:01.259
both of those were encrypted

0:01:01.660,0:01:04.086
either with  rsync plus GPG

0:01:04.086,0:01:07.589
or with a gcrypt or to say git plus GPG

0:01:09.100,0:01:10.270
now

0:01:10.270,0:01:11.440
What I

0:01:11.440,0:01:12.900
Love about git-annex

0:01:12.930,0:01:14.740
is that I can

0:01:14.740,0:01:16.362
drop this file from my laptop

0:01:16.362,0:01:18.640
if I feel that I don't have a need for it anymore

0:01:18.640,0:01:20.220
or if it's taking room

0:01:20.220,0:01:22.360
or for whatever reason

0:01:22.360,0:01:25.600
I don't need it actively on my laptop

0:01:25.840,0:01:31.320
But since git annex separates the content from the index

0:01:31.320,0:01:32.969
the file is still there...

0:01:32.969,0:01:35.760
well the file is not there, but I can see it

0:01:37.060,0:01:39.856
It's sort of unresolved

0:01:39.860,0:01:42.660
because if I try to do that,

0:01:42.660,0:01:45.120
the file is not there, I can't get to it

0:01:45.120,0:01:48.780
but if I check where it is

0:01:48.780,0:01:52.260
it will say okay is no longer in my laptop

0:01:52.420,0:01:55.200
but it exists in two different copies

0:01:55.200,0:01:57.540
in those virtual machines, and on the NAS

0:01:57.540,0:02:00.860
and then if I ever need it in any way,

0:02:01.320,0:02:03.800
hopefully before I go offline

0:02:03.980,0:02:05.240
then I just get that file

0:02:05.240,0:02:07.840
and it takes it from whichever storage

0:02:07.840,0:02:08.520
is the most convenient

0:02:09.009,0:02:10.937
And you can have any number of storages

0:02:10.937,0:02:12.568
you can mix and match as you want

0:02:13.069,0:02:15.348
you can have an SD card, on USB drives

0:02:15.780,0:02:17.180
you know -- you name it

0:02:17.340,0:02:19.240
and use them to set up

0:02:19.240,0:02:20.720
what kind of content you want where

0:02:20.720,0:02:23.840
and what priorities should be

0:02:23.840,0:02:26.040
for bringing things in order

0:02:26.040,0:02:27.660
and yeah there we had a file

0:02:27.660,0:02:28.920
that's git-annex

0:02:28.920,0:02:31.332
that's how I use it and that's why I love it

0:02:31.332,0:02:32.749
because I usually have a lot of

0:02:33.120,0:02:34.640
rather big files

0:02:34.640,0:02:37.700
that I shuffle around for videos and audio and whatever

0:02:39.090,0:02:43.187
And I don't have space for terabytes of data on my laptop,

0:02:43.187,0:02:46.789
but I still want to see the index of what I have so

0:02:47.430,0:02:49.010
with git-annex it is possible

0:02:49.010,0:02:50.992
to have an instant view

0:02:50.992,0:02:54.100
of all the files that I ever have

0:02:54.100,0:02:55.730
and I have everywhere.

0:02:56.579,0:02:59.054
But the files that I work with actively

0:02:59.054,0:03:02.418
are the ones that I actually have immediate access to.

0:03:02.639,0:03:05.029
The other ones I can retrieve when I need them
